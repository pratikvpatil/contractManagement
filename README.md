# Contract Management

## Background

In the world of capital projects, many organizations have the need to formally manage the financial terms of the contracts that they enter into. It is a direct and straightforward way to get a sense of how much money has been spent on a project, and how much money is expected to be received by the organization performing the work. Typically, this area is called Contract Management.

Contract managers have several areas of interest:
  - Budgets (how much money did I expect to spend/receive)
  - Commitments (how much money have I committed to spending/receiving)
  - Forecasts (how much money in the future will I have to spend/receive)
  - Payments (how much money has actually left/arrived in my bank account)

The combination of these items is sufficient to get a sense of the performance of the project from a financial perspective.

This project is implemented using a framework called [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/0.9.2/docs/) which bundles together the following tools:
  - Jetty for an HTTP Server
  - Jackson for serialization
  - Jersey for a REST framework
  - Hibernate for ORM
  - Liquibase for migrations
  - Mustache for view templating

The user interface is comprised of:
  - AngularJS
  - Bootstrap
